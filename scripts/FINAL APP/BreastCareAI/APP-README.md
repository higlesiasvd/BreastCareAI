- **Breast Ultrasound Analysis**: Advanced segmentation and BI-RADS classification of ultrasound images
- **Calendar Integration**: Medical appointment scheduling with question preparation
- **Medication Management**: Personalized medication reminder system
- **Medical Terminology Assistance**: Automatic detection and explanation of complex medical terms
- **Voice Interaction**: Optional voice input/output capabilities for accessibility
- **Patient Profile**: Personalized content based on diagnosis stage and preferences

## Technical Architecture

BreastCareAI is built on a modular architecture with Streamlit as the frontend framework and integrates multiple specialized components:

```

### Dependencies Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/higlesiasvd/breast-cancer-analysis.git
cd breast-cancer-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

### Setting Up Knowledge Base

1. Create a `knowledge_base` directory in the application root folder
2. Add PDF documents containing breast cancer information to this directory
3. The application will automatically process these documents at startup

### Google Calendar Setup (Optional)

For Google Calendar integration:

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable the Google Calendar API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
