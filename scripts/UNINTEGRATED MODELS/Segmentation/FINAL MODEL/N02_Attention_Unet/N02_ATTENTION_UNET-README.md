# Standard Attention U-Net for Breast Ultrasound Segmentation

## Project Overview

This repository implements an enhanced U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms specifically designed for breast cancer lesion segmentation in ultrasound images. The model achieves a high Dice coefficient score of 0.728, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance on the challenging task of breast lesion delineation.

Unlike the genetic algorithm (GA) optimized variant, this standard implementation uses fixed hyperparameters and a straightforward training process, resulting in better segmentation metrics and a more reliable model. While the GA approach can reduce training time, this standard implementation prioritizes segmentation quality, making it the preferred choice for applications where accuracy is paramount.

## Introduction

Breast ultrasound imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool for breast cancer detection due to its non-invasive nature, lack of radiation, and real-time capability. Automatic segmentation of lesions in ultrasound images presents several challenges:

- Low contrast between lesions and surrounding tissue
- Presence of speckle noise and acoustic shadows
- Heterogeneous appearance of lesions
- Variable image quality and acquisition parameters
- Significant class imbalance (small lesion-to-background ratio)

This project addresses these challenges by implementing an attention-enhanced U-Net architecture. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant image regions, improving segmentation accuracy particularly around lesion boundaries where precision is most critical.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the BUSI (Breast Ultrasound Images) dataset:

- **Dataset Source**: Al-Dhabyani W, Gomaa M, Khaled H, Fahmy A. Dataset of breast ultrasound images. Data in Brief. 2020.
- **Contents**: 780 breast ultrasound images with corresponding ground truth segmentation masks
- **Categories**: Normal, benign, and malignant cases
- **Format**: Grayscale PNG images with binary segmentation masks
- **Splitting**: 75% training, 25% testing (randomly stratified)

## Model Architecture

The implemented architecture is based on U-Net with the addition of attention gates:

### Overall Structure

- **Encoder Path**: Four downsampling blocks with progressive channel expansion (1→64→128→256→512→1024)
- **Bottleneck**: Convolution block at the deepest layer (1024 channels)
- **Decoder Path**: Four upsampling blocks with skip connections from encoder
- **Attention Gates**: Applied to skip connections to filter relevant features
- **Output Layer**: 1×1 convolution with sigmoid activation for binary segmentation

### Building Blocks

#### Convolutional Block

```python
class ConvBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channel, out_channel, dropout):
        super(ConvBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv2d_1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channel, out_channel, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.batchnorm_1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channel)
        self.relu_1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.conv2d_2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channel, out_channel, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.batchnorm_2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channel)
        self.relu_2 = nn.ReLU()
```

Each convolutional block consists of:

- Two consecutive convolutional layers (3×3 kernels, padding=1)
- Batch normalization after each convolution
- ReLU activation
- Dropout for regularization

#### Encoder Block

```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channel, out_channel, dropout):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.conv2d_1 = ConvBlock(input_channel, out_channel, dropout)
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d((2,2))
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
```

Each encoder block:

- Processes input features through a convolutional block
- Applies max pooling for downsampling (2×2, stride=2)
- Returns both the feature maps before pooling (for skip connections) and the downsampled features

#### Decoder Block with Attention

```python
class Decoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channel, output_channel, dropout):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.conv_t = nn.ConvTranspose2d(input_channel, output_channel, stride=2, kernel_size=2)
        # Add attention mechanism
        self.attention = SimpleAttention(output_channel)
        self.conv2d_1 = ConvBlock(output_channel*2, output_channel, dropout)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
```

Each decoder block:

- Upsamples features using transposed convolution (2×2, stride=2)
- Applies attention to the corresponding encoder features
- Concatenates attention-filtered features with the upsampled features
- Processes the combined features through a convolutional block

#### Complete Architecture

```python
class AttentionUnet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channel=1):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder_1 = Encoder(input_channel, 64, 0.07)
        self.encoder_2 = Encoder(64, 128, 0.08)
        self.encoder_3 = Encoder(128, 256, 0.09)
        self.encoder_4 = Encoder(256, 512, 0.1)
        self.conv_block = ConvBlock(512, 1024, 0.11)
      
        # Decoders with attention
        self.decoder_1 = Decoder(1024, 512, 0.1)
        self.decoder_2 = Decoder(512, 256, 0.09)
        self.decoder_3 = Decoder(256, 128, 0.08)
        self.decoder_4 = Decoder(128, 64, 0.07)
      
        self.cls = nn.Conv2d(64, 1, kernel_size=1, padding=0)
        self.relu = nn.Sigmoid()
```

The architecture uses a progressive dropout strategy, with rates gradually increasing in deeper layers (0.07 → 0.08 → 0.09 → 0.10 → 0.11) and then decreasing symmetrically in the decoder path.

## Attention Mechanism

The key innovation in this implementation is the attention mechanism applied to skip connections:

```python
class SimpleAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels):
        super(SimpleAttention, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, 1, kernel_size=1)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
      
    def forward(self, x):
        # Generate attention map
        attn = self.conv(x)
        attn = self.sigmoid(attn)
        # Apply attention to the input
        return x * attn
```

This mechanism:

1. Generates a spatial attention map using a 1×1 convolution
2. Applies sigmoid activation to normalize values between 0 and 1
3. Multiplies the input feature map with the attention map (element-wise)
4. This creates a gating effect where relevant features are preserved while irrelevant ones are suppressed

The attention gates function as learned feature selectors, automatically guiding the model to focus on the relevant regions (lesions) and suppress background noise.

## Training Process

The training process is implemented through a custom `Trainer` class that handles model training, validation, and performance tracking:

```python
class Trainer:
    def __init__(self, model, num_epochs, optimizer, criterion, device):
        self.num_epochs = num_epochs
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.criterion = criterion
        self.model = model
        self.device = device
        self.log_interval = 15
      
        # Training and validation metrics
        self.train_losses = []
        self.val_losses = []
        self.train_dices = []
        self.val_dices = []
      
        # Best model tracking
        self.best_model = None
        self.best_dice = 0.0
        self.best_epoch = 0
```

Key components of the training process:

- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.0001 and weight decay 1e-6
- **Batch Size**: 16
- **Image Size**: 128×128 pixels
- **Model Initialization**: Xavier/Kaiming initialization
- **Best Model Saving**: Automatic saving of the model with the best validation Dice score

The training loop updates both the train and validation metrics after each epoch, providing comprehensive tracking of model performance:

```python
def train(self, train_loader, val_loader):
    for epoch in range(self.num_epochs):
        train_loss = 0.0
        val_loss = 0.0
        train_dice = 0.0
        val_dice = 0.0
      
        # Training loop
        # ...
      
        # Validation loop
        # ...
      
        # Calculate averages
        avg_train_loss = train_loss / len(train_loader)
        avg_val_loss = val_loss / len(val_loader)
        avg_train_dice = train_dice / len(train_loader)
        avg_val_dice = val_dice / len(val_loader)
      
        # Print metrics
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch + 1}/{self.num_epochs}], Train Loss: {avg_train_loss:.4f}, Val Loss: {avg_val_loss:.4f}')
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch + 1}/{self.num_epochs}], Train Dice: {avg_train_dice:.4f}, Val Dice: {avg_val_dice:.4f}')
      
        # Save metrics
        self.train_losses.append(avg_train_loss)
        self.val_losses.append(avg_val_loss)
        self.train_dices.append(avg_train_dice)
        self.val_dices.append(avg_val_dice)
      
        # Save best model
        self.save_best_model(epoch + 1, avg_val_dice)
```

## Loss Functions

The model is trained using a combined Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Dice loss function:

```python
def dice_coef_loss(inputs, target):
    smooth = 1e-6
    intersection = 2.0 * (target*inputs).sum() + smooth
    union = target.sum() + inputs.sum() + smooth
    return 1 - (intersection/union)

def bce_dice_loss(inputs, target):
    dice_score = dice_coef_loss(inputs, target)
    bce_loss = nn.BCELoss()
    bce_score = bce_loss(inputs, target)
    return bce_score + dice_score
```

The combination of BCE and Dice loss provides several advantages:

- **BCE loss**: Provides stable, pixel-wise supervision
- **Dice loss**: Addresses class imbalance by focusing on the overlap between prediction and ground truth
- **Combined loss**: Captures both pixel-level accuracy and structural similarity

## Experimental Results

The model was trained for 50 epochs on 75% of the dataset and evaluated on the remaining 25%.

### Performance Metrics

- **Best Validation Dice Coefficient**: 0.728
- **Final Training Dice Coefficient**: 0.890
- **Final Validation Dice Coefficient**: 0.695

The model shows excellent performance on the training set and good generalization to the validation set, indicating effective learning of lesion segmentation patterns.

### Comparison with GA-Optimized Version

Compared to the genetically-optimized version, this standard implementation achieves:

- **Better Segmentation Accuracy**: Dice score of 0.728 vs. 0.562
- **More Stable Training**: Smoother convergence in loss and metrics
- **Longer Training Time**: Requires more computational resources but delivers superior results

The standard implementation is recommended for applications where segmentation accuracy is the primary concern, while the GA-optimized version might be preferred in resource-constrained environments where training speed is critical.

### Qualitative Results

Visual inspection of the segmentation results shows that the model performs well on most cases, successfully identifying lesion boundaries even in challenging images with low contrast or complex background tissue.

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of a standard attention-enhanced U-Net architecture for breast ultrasound segmentation. The model achieves a high Dice coefficient of 0.728, indicating excellent segmentation performance on this challenging medical imaging task.

Key strengths of this implementation include:

1. **Superior Segmentation Accuracy**: The model achieves significantly better Dice scores compared to the GA-optimized version (0.728 vs. 0.562)
2. **Attention Mechanism**: The incorporation of attention gates helps the model focus on relevant features and improves boundary delineation
3. **Stable Training**: The progressive dropout strategy and carefully selected hyperparameters ensure stable convergence
4. **Balanced Loss Function**: The combined BCE-Dice loss addresses both pixel-wise accuracy and structural similarity
5. **Simplicity and Reproducibility**: The straightforward implementation ensures reliable results across different runs

While the standard implementation requires more training time compared to the genetically optimized version, the significant improvement in segmentation quality justifies the additional computational cost for applications where accuracy is paramount.

This implementation is particularly suitable for clinical applications where precise lesion boundary delineation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. For scenarios where computational resources are limited or rapid model development is needed, the GA-optimized version remains a viable alternative.

Future improvements could include:
